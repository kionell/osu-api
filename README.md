# osu-api
API clients for different osu! servers.

This was intended as a wrapper for all popular osu! related servers. All data is adapted to the classes from [osu-classes](https://github.com/kionell/osu-classes) for internal usage in the [osu-pp-bot](https://github.com/kionell/osu-pp-bot) project.
I don't recommend using this for a different project but you can try though.
